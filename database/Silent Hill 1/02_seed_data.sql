  ('Groaner or Canine Monster Type A', 'Silent Hill 1', 'Feral aggression, born of the deep-seated fear of dogs stirred by Alessa Gillespie''s trauma', 'Appears in foggy streets, hunts the player in packs'),
  ('Mutated Wormhead or Canine Monster Type B', 'Silent Hill 1', 'Embodies the primal fear of insanity and a warped reality', 'More aggressive than Groaner, delivers stronger attacks with heightened awareness'),
  ('Incubus', 'Silent Hill 1', 'Final boss representing the deity worshipped by the Order, its physical form a twisted manifestation of corrupted ideals', 'Flies and attacks with area lightning strikes'),
  ('Air Screamer or Avian Monster Type A', 'Silent Hill 1', 'Symbolizes childhood fears and school trauma (inspired partly by “The Lost World” book)', 'Executes erratic flights with aggressive dive-bomb attacks'),
  ('Grey Children or Demon Children', 'Silent Hill 1', 'Manifest the suffering of childhood and the torment endured at home and school', 'Hunt in packs using knife-wielding, relentless pursuit'),
  ('Dahlia Gillespie', 'Silent Hill 1', 'Personifies religious fanaticism, abuse, and the perversion of motherhood', 'Manipulates events through occult practices, blurring the lines of morality'),
  ('Romper', 'Silent Hill 1', 'Represents Alessa''s fear of adults', 'It is a quadrupedal creature with an ape-like body that locomotes by jumping, using body blows to pin its victims to the ground.'),
  ('Alessa Gillespie (Nightmare Manifestation)', 'Silent Hill 1', 'Embodies repressed trauma, inner turmoil, and the duality of innocence corrupted by horror', 'Appears as shifting, spectral visions that distort reality and unsettle the protagonist'),
  ('Mumbler', 'Silent Hill 1', 'Takes on a dark image of small menacing animals and demons from fairy tales that Alessa Gillespie used to read from her childhood', 'They replace the Grey Child seen in the North American version, and are visual representations of Grey Children in some iterations of Silent Hill 1'),
  ('Puppet Nurse or Monsterized Nurses', 'Silent Hill 1', 'The parasite that controls the Nurses is the same as the ones controlling Cybil Bennett after she becomes possessed, these monsters are created from Alessa''s memories of her hospitalization and of the nurses who worked there, including Lisa Garland.', 'They are the nurses who worked at Alchemilla Hospital, but became mindless hosts of the parasites, they carry scalpels, which was mainly used to attack the protagonist. Hunt in packs and will utilized smart tactics in groupings to carry out attacks against Harry'),
  ('Puppet Doctors or Monsterized Doctors', 'Silent Hill 1', 'Similarly to the Puppet Nurses, these are Otherworld-ly depictions of hospital doctors. They may also represent Alessa''s hatred of doctors, which was caused by her confinement in her hospital room.', 'Accompany other Puppets to carry out their attack with their knife, slower but stronger than Puppet Nurses.'),
  ('Creeper', 'Silent Hill 1', 'They are manifestations of Alessia Gillespie''s strong dislike of insects', 'They were first encountered by Harry Mason when the town of Silent Hill was under Nightmare Influence.'),
  ('Bloodsucker', 'Silent Hill 1', 'They serve as the embodiment of Alessa Gillespie''s hatred of leeches, worms, snakes, and other insects', 'In the hospital, it is found in Room 204, sucking at a puddle of blood. It becomes aggressive once Harry Mason approaches it, so he must distract it in order to reach the Plate of Hatter behind it.'),
  ('Night Flutter', 'Silent Hill 1', 'The Night Flutter''s worm head may symbolize Alessa Gillespie''s disgust for worms and the like. The worms could also symbolize change, particularly the change that the Otherworld brings, or deterioration similar to how ants symbolize deterioration in artwork by Salvador Dalí. The Night Flutter could also prove symbolic of Harry''s belief he may be losing grasp on his sanity, and could also stand for the overall decomposition of all things he had originally known as orthodox. Worms are common decomposers, and seeing a mass of the creatures completing shrouding sight of the creature''s head could be a metaphor for one''s sanity being eaten away. It is also noteworthy that the Night Flutter, compared to its Fog World counterpart, looks more similar to Incubus, especially in skin tone and wing anatomy.', 'The Night Flutter (also known as Avian Monster Type B) is a flying enemy appearing in Silent Hill. It is the stronger variation of the Air Screamer appearing later in the game.'),
  ('Monster Cybil', 'Silent Hill 1', 'No particular Symbolism', 'Monster Cybil (known more accurately as Parasitic Host Cybil) is a major boss in Silent Hill. Cybil Bennett becomes host to the same kind of parasite that infected the Puppet Nurses and Puppet Doctors. Cybil appears in Lakeside Amusement Park''s merry-go-round, sitting in a wheelchair, but stands up when Harry Mason enters. Killing her will result in the Good or Bad ending, while saving her will award the player with the Good+ or Bad+ ending.'),
  ('Parasite', 'Silent Hill 1', 'Not much about the Parasite''s meaning is known, but along with the other monsters, they are likely to be connected to Alessa Gillespie. They may be related to the God''s fetus in Alessa''s womb, as the God can be seen as a parasite to Alessa''s body, nourishing off her hatred and fear. It also might represent Alessa''s feelings of how the Order is manipulating her life, as well as controlling the people around her, given their ability to control other living things.', 'The Parasite is a mysterious mind-controlling monster that makes its only appearance in the first Silent Hill game. It infects the entire staff of Alchemilla Hospital (with the exception of Michael Kaufmann), the Puppet Nurses and Puppet Doctors as well as Cybil Bennett. There is also speculation that it infected Lisa Garland. It seems to be weak to Aglaophotis, which is shown to completely reverse the parasite''s effects on Puppet Cybil Bennett. It is also implied that Aglaophotis is also made from White Claudia, suggesting White Claudia may be the ingredient which attacks the parasite. PTV is produced from White Claudia as well, which may be the reason Lisa didn''t transform as soon as her co-workers, if she was infected.'),
  ('Floatstinger', 'Silent Hill 1', 'It''s the mature form of the Twinfeeler. The Floatstinger''s appearance is reminiscent of the insect specimens hanging on the walls of Alessa Gillespie''s room in her home.', 'The Floatstinger is a boss in Silent Hill and the mature form of the Twinfeeler, which Harry Mason previously fights at the Silent Hill Town Center. It is located atop the roof of the post office, across from Alchemilla Hospital. The Floatstinger''s death shifts the Otherworld back to the Fog World.'),
  ('Split Head', 'Silent Hill 1', 'The Split Head is the hellish incarnation and transfiguration of a great lizard that appears in a fairy tale from the elementary school. The notes on the reception desk in the school state that, at 5:00, "flames render the silence, awakening the hungry beast". That and the fact that the noise heard when the player activates the boiler (changing the clock tower to 5:00) is the exact same noise made by the Split Head. This would suggest that whenever Alessa Gillespie heard the boiler when she was at school, she would imagine it to be the lizard from the fairy tale, causing its subsequent manifestation in her manifested world. The area in which the player fights the Split Head also contains symbolism of Alessa, the burning figure in the center representing the live burning of Alessa by her mother, Dahlia Gillespie.', 'The Split Head is a creature that Harry Mason encounters within the Otherworld version of the boiler room of Midwich Elementary School in Silent Hill. Upon its defeat, a shift back to the Fog World is triggered. The Split Head is the very first boss battle in the entire Silent Hill series.'),
  ('Twinfeeler', 'Silent Hill 1', 'Alessa Gillespie had a number of insect specimens in her room, these including butterflies and moths. The Twinfeeler is a manifestation of one of these insects.', 'The Twinfeeler is a boss from Silent Hill, and the larval form of the later-seen Floatstinger. After an Otherworld transition at the Green Lion Antiques store, Harry Mason looks for a way to make it to the Resort Area and deviates through the Silent Hill Town Center. When Harry reaches the second floor, he encounters two smaller Twinfeelers feeding on a corpse. However, when Harry attempts to walk to it, the catwalk drops and Harry falls into the previously unreachable gun shop, which a larger Twinfeeler inhabits.'),
  ('Incubator', 'Silent Hill 1', 'The name "Incubator" signifies an incubator for a premature baby; in this case, the "baby" is a demonic god, the Incubus. The Incubator is Alessa''s mental image of God, which is much more saintly and "pure" in appearance than the Incubus, which also symbolizes Alessa''s innocent ideals. The Incubator also appears to be Alessa, only more adult-like. The Incubator''s death (as Alessa) in the Good and Good+ endings may be also considered similar to the death of the god in the myths of the Order: she died due to overuse of her powers.', 'The Incubator makes her appearance in the mysterious realm of Nowhere. She is seen in all four ending routes; however, she is only fought in the non-canonical Bad and Bad+ endings, where she serves as the final boss.'),
  ('Larval Stalker', 'Silent Hill 1', 'The giggles that can be heard when Harry approach a Larval Stalker evokes memories of Alessa Gillespie being bullied and teased during school, where she was continuously teased and told to "drop dead" by classmates. They present a tendency to follow around Harry and sometimes continuously pace around him.', 'Larval Stalkers are dark, translucent, ghost-like entities in Silent Hill. They appear to be a premature form of the Stalker, which, like the Larval Stalker, is partially invisible, but has the shape of the similar Grey Child, and unlike the Larval Stalker, will damage the player.'),
  ('Hanged Scratcher', 'Silent Hill 1', 'Hanged Scratchers may represent the image of a composite of many insect specimens, due to Alessa Gillespie''s fear of insects, the only exceptions being butterflies and moths. Crickets or locusts have the most prevalent resemblance to the Scratchers. The fact that they appear and move very reptillian-esque in nature could be akin to dragons, alluding to Alessa''s love for fairytales. They could also represent the Order''s penchant for abducting young girls, as one member would later attempt with Alessa''s second reincarnation. This could explain their persistence when pursuing Harry and how, when they attack, they seem to screech "Let go of me!".', 'Hanged Scratchers, also called Sewer Demons or Sewer Creatures, are creatures that dwell in the sewers of Silent Hill, appearing in the first game.'),
  ('Stalker', 'Silent Hill 1', 'Stalkers are essentially the dangerous form of Larval Stalkers, which represented how "invisible" and neglected Alessa Gillespie felt in school due to the cruel treatment from her peers. While Larval Stalkers are shy and seclusive, Stalkers pose a real threat and could be symbolic of Alessa''s anger emerging and becoming known.', 'Stalkers are creatures that appear in Silent Hill. They appear to be the matured form of the Larval Stalker, which are merely silent apparitions, passive in behavior and otherwise harmless. They are first encountered in the sewers of Silent Hill, appearing near the end of Harry Mason''s journey through the town. They are also present at the Lakeside Amusement Park and in certain sections of Nowhere.'),

  (18, 'The Split Head faintly resembles a lizard, although its head has only extremely obscure facial features, almost making it impossible to discern parts of its face.

Its head appears to be a bloated, mutated mass. The Split Head has the ability to open up its head, or "mouth", horizontally to reveal a seemingly toothless maw but with extremely powerful jaws.', 'Large', 'Indistinct facial features, lizard-like creatures that are severely mutated.'),
