  ('Bottom', 'Silent Hill 4: The Room', 'In the Official Strategy Guide by Piggy Bank Interactive, it is stated that the Bottom was created by Walter Sullivan''s memory and disdain for his parents for abandoning him. They are only encountered in South Ashfield Heights, supporting this symbolism. The way that the monster is presented, with the head at the bottom and the arms outstretched to either side, could suggest Walter''s childbirth, specifically in the lithotomy position, since Walter was born in Room 302. The figure appears to have two faceless lumps at the top which could represent the heads of Walter''s parents on each side, due to Walter not knowing the identities of his parents. It should also be noted that the Bottoms say "receiver" like the Twin Victims, which is Henry''s role as the 21st Sacrament. This is mostly an allusion to Henry''s purpose in the ritual.', 'Bottom is a monster from Silent Hill 4: The Room that appears during the second visit to South Ashfield Heights.'),
  ('Eileen Head', 'Silent Hill 4: The Room', 'Since the Otherworld in Silent Hill 4 is most likely caused by Walter Sullivan, it may be a reflection of his thoughts or psyche. Eileen was supposed to be another sacrifice, but she survived, which the scars may represent. Her breathing may also be interpreted as being sexual and orgasmic, as if she is engaging in coitus or masturbation, or other forms of genital stimulation. This could allude to conception and her role as a sacrifice, since she is the "Mother Reborn". The head may represent Henry''s violation of Eileen''s privacy. Throughout the game, Henry may repeatedly check Eileen, akin to the Peeping Tom story. Although it can be argued Henry is doing it to see if Eileen is okay, the fact remains that he is spying on her. The head may be an inversion of this - now, Henry is the one being watched. However, the head still appears no matter what, regardless of how often Henry checks on Eileen.  Another theory is that the head represents Henry''s concerns for Eileen''s safety. It is evident that Henry cares about Eileen. He doesn''t want Eileen to die or be sick, and he isn''t certain whether or not she''s still alive during the hospital level. Henry coming (literally) face-to-face with a diseased-looking Eileen is likely uncomfortable for Henry and a manifestation of his fears. Another theory is that the head is Eileen''s monster and manifested by Eileen''s feelings, and a subconscious manifestation of her internalized trauma from being beaten and nearly killed.', 'Eileen Head is a creature found in a room within the Otherworld version of St. Jerome''s Hospital in Silent Hill 4: The Room.'),
  ('Greedy Worm', 'Silent Hill 4: The Room', 'The Greedy Worms may link Walter''s worlds, spanning universes. However, they do not seem to appear in the Building World, Hospital World or Apartment World, meaning that the idea of Greedy Worms "linking" Walter''s worlds could be false since they only appear in 3 out of 6, or half of Walter''s worlds. It can be theorized that the Greedy Worm symbolizes the umbilical cord, although this has never been officially proven. If this theory is true, the Greedy Worm may represent Walter''s dismay of being separated from his mother and her "magic cord", as described in a memo found in Room 302 of the Past, although the memo doesn''t specifically address the Greedy Worm. The name may hint at Walter feeling as if he was a lowly parasite to his real mother, with the umbilical cord being a "greedy worm" that stole nourishment from her. These feelings may have originated from the careless treatment and abandonment of him after he was born, and would help facilitate the belief that the room was his real mother.', 'The Greedy Worm is an unkillable monster that debuted in Silent Hill 4: The Room and then reappeared in Silent Hill: The Arcade.'),
  ('Gum Head', 'Silent Hill 4: The Room', 'The Gum Heads may be a representation of Walter Sullivan''s misanthropic views of the majority of society, his fear of adults as a child, and generally negative of humanity, perhaps even viewing them as "monstrous". They appear masculine and not feminine; it is likely that they symbolize men, while the Patients probably symbolize how Walter views women. Some Gum Heads holds weapons, which gives the beasts an authoritative air and the ability to abuse, like Walter was abused by Andrew DeSalvo. The fact that Gum Heads have a strong tendency to steal items from Henry may indicate Walter views people as greedy and self-interested. Their blurry, indistinguishable, indiscernible faces may symbolize people''s lack of individual identity to Walter and how no one seems "real" to Walter, only copies of one another. This can be seen through his attitude when he kills others, not really seeing the people as fellow sentient beings, but simply sacrifices that must be handled to see his "mother". Their similarity to apes and monkeys may represent how Walter views humanity as primitive, of lower intellect and consciousness. Gum Heads come in two varieties, dubbed Old and New. New Type Gum Heads almost look as if they are wearing pants and their eyes are almost more discernible, but their neck growth appears bloodier as well. This could symbolize how Walter sees civilization, and how regardless of what clothes men wear, their original behavior and inherent dark nature remains the same. When Gum Heads approach Henry, they have a tendency to waddle side-to-side and rarely attack him immediately, almost as if they are enticed by Henry and are trying to analyze him, almost as if they are wondering, "Is he one of us or not?" This gives more credence to them being Walter''s idea of "humans". The Gum Heads also have tumorous growths that may symbolize how Walter views humanity as a cancer or disease to the planet, or his general negative view of people. The growths appear on the neck, dangling from their mouths, and over their hearts/chest area, which might symbolize how people can say harmful/hurtful things, or hold harmful/hurtful things in their metaphorical "heart".', 'A Gum Head, also known as a Rubber Face, is a type of monster in Silent Hill 4: The Room. They are ape-like beings that are often found in groups. They also appear in Silent Hill: The Arcade.'),
  ('Twin Victim', 'Silent Hill 4: The Room', 'The Twin Victims are manifestations of Walter Sullivan''s seventh and eight victims, twins Billy and Miriam Locane, who were first mentioned in Silent Hill 2. They are the only two of Walter''s victims that have been reincarnated into the form of a monster instead of ghosts. Although this makes sense for the creatures'' origin, it is unknown why there are so many of them. However, this can possibly be explained by a potential latter meaning. The Twin Victims are essentially conjoined twins, which occurs when a fertilized cell fails to split properly, rendering both beings becoming fused together. A main theme in the game is Walter''s demented level of attachment and misunderstanding of his mother, and it is revealed throughout the gameplay of just how "attached" he is to her. The Twin Victims could also be a manifestation of this severe attachment.', 'The Twin Victim, also known as Doublehead, are an enemy from Silent Hill 4: The Room, first encountered in the Water Prison. A similar variant called Bottoms appear in South Ashfield Heights.'),
  ('Patient', 'Silent Hill 4: The Room', 'Represents Walter''s warped perspective of care, healing and salvation. They carry on the series tradition of medical/hospital imagery but weave it more specifically into Walter’s ritualistic violence and Eileen’s slow decline.', 'Patients are monsters in Silent Hill 4: The Room. They can usually be found in the Hospital World and the second visit to the Apartment World.'),
  ('Ghost', 'Silent Hill 4: The Room', 'There are two "series" of ghosts, Old Types and New Types, with Old Types being more prevalent. Old Type Ghosts are Walter''s victims from a time before Henry moved into the apartment. They behave, for the most part, much like each other and are more or less interchangeable and equally threatening. There are only four New Type Ghosts, which are all characters Henry met the first time in each world, who met a grisly fate at Walter''s hands. They are each quite different from each other and are menacing in their own respects.', 'Ghosts are common enemies found in Silent Hill 4: The Room, appearing in each world and are a frequent nuisance, as they cannot be killed or disposed of in a truly permanent way. The Ghosts are the tormented souls of Walter Sullivan''s numerous victims, who roam in his worlds. They appear out of walls, leaving gooey spatters of blood as they emerge, and then float around after Henry Townshend with the intent of killing him. Even being near them is harmful to Henry, as he suffers intense headaches and even takes damage over time, much like being near the haunting of his apartment. They also attack by reaching into Henry''s chest and grabbing at his heart, doing even more damage this way. Ghosts make zombie-like groaning noises, and appear as rotten, undead reflections of their former selves.'),
  ('Toby Archbolt', 'Silent Hill 4: The Room', 'His ghost has a visible injury on the head, implying that Toby died by cranial trauma. He was the fourteenth of the 21 Sacraments killed by Walter Sullivan. ', 'Toby Archbolt was a priest of the Holy Mother Sect of the Order, which operated the Wish House Orphanage.'),
  ('Jimmy Stone or Victim 1', 'Silent Hill 4: The Room', 'Walter Sullivan shot him in the back of the head inside the basement of Wish House orphanage while he was reading some scriptures and removed his heart and became Victim 1. His ghost is encountered more often than others, in many other worlds and promos. As he is most common, it is useless to pin him. He additionally appears as one of the hauntings in Room 302 where he will slowly come out of the wall in any of the rooms and keeps looking at the room he is in.', 'Jimmy Stone is a cultist appearing in the Silent Hill series and a resident of Silent Hill, Maine. A descendant of Reverend Stone, he is a priest and executioner of the town''s cult who serves under the angel of rebirth Valtiel. The character is nicknamed the Red Devil because of the triangular red hood worn by the executioners during ritualistic murders. He was first mentioned in a newspaper article in Silent Hill 2, before making his physical debut as a ghost in Silent Hill 4: The Room.'),
  ('Eric Walsh or Victim 10', 'Silent Hill 4: The Room', '', 'Eric Walsh is the final victim of Walter Sullivan''s initial rampage in Silent Hill 4: The Room. Eric worked as a bartender at Bar Southfield. On his birthday, a middle-aged customer told him that the pet store owner, Steve Garland, was murdered and the murderer was still at large, causing the bar''s owner to close the bar early. Eric returned home, only to find Walter waiting for him. Walter shot him in the face and removed his heart. Eric is known as Victim 10. His memory is represented as a Billiard Ball the player later uses to escape from the Building World.'),
  ('The One Truth', 'Silent Hill 4: The Room', 'The One Truth is the guardian of Walter Sullivan''s "mother", appearing just before the final level. It could be a test for Henry to find the "truth" among lies and deceit, as a challenge for the Receiver of Wisdom. After defeating the One Truth, Joseph Schreiber reveals the truth about Walter to Henry. It is also generally representative of the twisted and mangled "truths" that the Order spreads, including its dogmatic teachings. Many real world religions maintain that they alone are "the one truth" and shut out other forms of thinking. The One Truth, whose body blocks a series of windows or door frames, preventing them from being used to see new things and go new places, seems to represent that.', 'The One Truth, also known as the Dummy, is one of the few bosses of Silent Hill 4: The Room. It is a larger, more powerful version of the Wall Man.'),
  ('Toadstool', 'Silent Hill 4: The Room', 'The Toadstools most likely represent fungi. Like fungi, they are signs of spreading decay and death. Their shape could also be viewed as similar to an umbilical cord, with a fetus perhaps growing at the terminus. Also like a fungus, umbilical cords leech nutrients from that to which they are attached.', 'Toadstools are fungus-like creatures that inhabit the realms of Silent Hill 4: The Room, and also appear in Silent Hill: The Arcade. They are stationary and pose little threat.'),
  ('Tremer', 'Silent Hill 4: The Room', 'They are parasites that live off of the carrion and gore of Walter''s worlds. The Tremers appear as a manifestation of Walter''s feeling of disgust towards leeches. It is possible Walter or a childhood friend of his was forced to drink water or some liquid infested with leeches by the attending watchman at the Wish House Orphanage, Andrew DeSalvo, a sign of Andrew''s abusive nature towards children. This is implied by a note which says, "I had to drink something with black things in it." These present another example of Walter feeling as if he was a parasite to his mother. They may also symbolize the cult''s influence on Walter.', 'Tremers are large, leech-like creatures that inhabit Walter Sullivan''s Otherworld. They are not very threatening but are still considered a nuisance. Tremers also appear in the spin-off games Silent Hill: The Arcade and Silent Hill: Book of Memories.'),
  ('True Walter', 'Silent Hill 4: The Room', 'The creature seems to represent a facet of Walter''s soul and being, as well as his desires and state. The creature is nestled deep within the Otherworld of Room 302, which Young Walter believes to be his mother. As such, the creature could be symbolic of Walter returning to his "mother''s" uterus. It also shows the adult Walter''s "monstrous" nature, as opposed to Young Walter who displays Walter''s former self and good innocent qualities.', 'True Walter is a creature appearing in Silent Hill 4: The Room. Henry Townshend confronts it, along with Walter, as the game''s final boss.'),
  ('Hummer', 'Silent Hill 4: The Room', 'Hummers are likely representative of pests, given their persistence in pursuing Henry, their appearance, and the creature''s sound. Them coalescing to pester him at once also supports this, and they are easy to dispose of with a single strike. Walter Sullivan''s psyche bore symbols of filth and disgust for the world around him, and these small creatures are likely an example.', 'Hummers, also known as Mothbats, are flying creatures from Silent Hill 4: The Room and Silent Hill: The Arcade. They usually show up in swarms and attack Henry Townshend on sight.'),
  ('Sniffer Dog', 'Silent Hill 4: The Room', 'Their canine form is a reference to young Walter Sullivan''s fear of dogs after he visited a pet shop during his childhood and was nearly bitten by one. The numerous animal noises the Sniffer Dog make may also be a nod to the animals Walter killed in Garland''s pet shop. Additionally, their tongues bear a close resemblance to an umbilical cord, echoing Walter''s longing for his mother.', 'The Sniffer Dogs are canine creatures in Silent Hill 4: The Room that have long, prehensile tongues that they use to drain the blood of their prey. They serve the same function as Groaners and Double Heads from previous installments: continuing the theme of canine enemies.'),
  ('Sharon Blake or Victim 13', 'Silent Hill 4: The Room', 'No particular symbolism', 'Sharon Blake is a character in Silent Hill 4: The Room, who had been a target of the Order for some time. Her family were members of the Order, but she refused their requests (and later demands) to join. When she went looking for her family in the woods near Silent Hill, she discovered her family''s gravestones, at which point Walter Sullivan caught her and drowned her in Toluca Lake. Sharon Blake is known as Victim 13 in the game. Sharon''s item is her black hat found at the crime scene.'),
  ('Steve Garland or Victim 4', 'Silent Hill 4: The Room', 'No particular symbolism', 'Steve Garland is a character in Silent Hill 4: The Room. He operated a pet store in Ashfield named Garland''s, and preferred animals over humans. Steve was easily angered by people. His murder was particularly gruesome; after Walter Sullivan riddled his body with bullets from a submachine gun, leaving his chest undamaged so the heart could be removed, he proceeded to brutally kill all the animals in the store.'),
  ('Peter Walls or Victim 12', 'Silent Hill 4: The Room', 'No particular Symbolism', 'Peter Walls was the first of Walter Sullivan''s postmortem victims in Silent Hill 4: The Room, and is known as Victim 12 in the game. Peter was a marijuana addict. His corpse was found in a room in Hotel South Ashfield some six months after his death. He had apparently been beaten to death after he claimed he could see God. His item left behind is a marijuana joint found at an alley near Hotel South Ashfield. In Walter''s Otherworlds, Peter appears in Building World and in Building World (2nd Time).'),
  ('Wall Man', 'Silent Hill 4: The Room', 'Wall Men may represent Walter Sullivan''s possible claustrophobia and confinement and fear towards walls and closed spaces because he wasn''t allowed to go outside the Wish House Orphanage, which manifested into this creature. They may also represent how he was always being watched in his cell through the walls in the Water Prison. Another possible theory is that they represent how Walter feels about the people that surrounded him during his lifetime, as many of them seemed to hurt him, or kept him from his "mother". Thus the Wall Men come from a rather universal structure, walls, which can be found essentially everywhere.', 'Wall Men are monsters which appear almost everywhere in Silent Hill 4: The Room. A related monster, The One Truth, is one of the game''s few boss fights.'),
  ('Victim 16 or Cynthia Velasquez', 'Silent Hill 4: The Room', 'When Henry returns to the subway station later in the game, Cynthia has become victim 16 of the 21 Sacraments. She now comes after Henry as the other victims do. She slithers on the ground when being attacked and impales Henry with her bare hands to grab his heart. In the Subway World, she appears at the turnstiles, the Lynch Street Line platform, the men''s bathroom, and the King Street Line Platform. If she isn''t pinned down in the Subway World with a Sword of Obedience, she will appear in the Building World in Garland''s, the alleyway with restaurants, and the room with the numerous locked doors. She will also haunt Room 203 in Apartment World.', 'Cynthia Velasquez is a character in Silent Hill 4: The Room. A flirtatious Hispanic woman, Cynthia becomes trapped in Walter Sullivan''s Subway Otherworld. She is later murdered as the 16th Sacrament, "Temptation".'),
  ('Victim 17 or Jasper Gein', 'Silent Hill 4: The Room', 'No particular symbolism', 'Jasper Gein is a somewhat mentally unbalanced man who appears in Silent Hill 4: The Room. Along with his friends, Bobby Randolph and Sein Martin, Jasper was fascinated by the mythology of the Order, making it his goal to find out all he could about the cult and its teachings. Unfortunately for Jasper, Bobby and Sein were killed about ten years ago. While exploring the ruins of the Wish House Orphanage in a surreal world resembling Silent Hill Woods, Walter Sullivan immolated Jasper, who seemed almost appreciative of the act.'),
  ('Victim 18 or Andrew DeSalvo', 'Silent Hill 4: The Room', 'No particular symbolism', 'Andrew DeSalvo is a nervous man who Henry Townshend meets locked in a cell in the Water Prison World in Silent Hill 4: The Room. Prior to the game, Andrew was employed by the Order as a guard at the Wish House Orphanage and the Water Prison, although he was not a member of the Order himself, where he was abusive to the children there. It is hinted in Walter''s diary that he may have killed Walter Sullivan''s childhood friend ''Bob'' or at least caused Bob''s disappearance. The Prisoner''s Shirt implies that Andrew may have made Walter or someone else drink water with leeches in it.'),
  ('Victim 19 or Richard Braintree', 'Silent Hill 4: The Room', 'No particular symbolism', 'Richard Braintree is a character in Silent Hill 4: The Room. He is Henry Townshend''s neighbor from Room 207. Richard lived in Room 207 of South Ashfield Heights. He is an eccentric, angry and somewhat violent or possibly sadistic man who carries a revolver along with him. Remembering Joseph Schreiber''s sudden disappearance, he becomes concerned when he notices the same thing happening again in Room 302. Richard also seems to be on good relations with Eileen Galvin, as Richard and Eileen are seen having a friendly conversation together. When Walter Sullivan traveled to South Ashfield Heights as a small child, Richard often noticed him. Richard was suspicious of Walter, and was often aggressive with him, as he believed Walter didn''t belong there. As a child, Walter wrote that "The city is scary and the apartment where mommy is has a scary guy in it." An incident occurred where Richard peeled off the clothes of a man named Mike, who was a perverted stalker living in the apartments who was despised by the other residents. As Walter was in the crowd and saw Richard holding bloody clothes, Walter may have misunderstood the situation and thought that Richard literally "skinned" Mike and that he was a homicidal killer.'),
  ('Wheelchair', 'Silent Hill 4: The Room', 'Much like the Patients, they may represent Walter''s distaste for hospitals, and helplessness in general. When Walter was an abandoned baby and child, he was essentially at the mercy of the world, unable to help himself. Additionally, they are simply a manifestation of the supernatural forces at hand. Wheelchairs may also just be enemies created for an appropriate environment.', 'Wheelchairs are found frequently in the Silent Hill series, appearing quite often in a variety of locations such as alleyways, hospitals, and even abandoned buildings. In Silent Hill 4: The Room, an enemy in the form of a possessed wheelchair makes itself a hazardous foe.'),
  ('Walter Sullivan', 'Silent Hill 4: The Room', 'The main antagonist of Silent Hill 4: The Room. Walter''s fear, hatred, and animosity towards humanity and the world seemed to manifest itself into monsters such as the Gum Heads (misandry) and Patients (misogyny), and his Otherworld was filled with macabre and disfigured human-like dolls and corpses.', 'He was an infamous serial killer, killing at least nineteen people (including two children), and a religious fanatic, courtesy of the Order''s beliefs being imposed upon him as a child. Attempting to fulfill a macabre ritual called the 21 Sacraments, his life''s goal was to cleanse the world of its sins. As a young boy, Walter considered the apartment room he was born in to be his "mother". In reality, both his mother and father had abandoned him at birth. The Otherworld explored throughout the game, as well as the monsters which inhabit it, were created by Walter. They symbolize his past, fears and views of society. During the game, four Walters appear. One is a little boy which is merely a manifestation. One is an adult man who wanders the Otherworld. One is a crucified corpse in a sealed-off room in reality. The final "Walter" is said to be the "Conjurer" and has Walter''s spiritual essence.');

  (12, 'Toadstools are tall, slender, and they bulge out at the top of their stems, often equaling Henry Townshend''s height.

Its pale and unfitting flesh could also be seen as reminiscent to that of a problematically-developing fetus. It is suspended from the ceiling by chains and long strands of tubing similar to umbilical cords.

Under ghost form, Jasper Gein is still ablaze and haunts the Forest World during Henry''s return. He wields a candlestick with which he uses to carry out attacks.', 'Medium', 'Blazing silhouette of the late Jasper Gein, who died from a fatal burn. His body was found with chest carving that read "17/21".'),
  (23, 'Andrew DeSalvo was a middle-aged man often with a pained expression on his face. He was seen wearing a blue buttoned shirt, although we see his ghost form topless exposing his markings of sacrafice. Being one the 21 victims, Andrew DeSalvo died drowing. His ghost form has decayed skin and blood red markings on his lower torso. He carries out water attacks.', 'Medium', 'The ghost of Andrew DeSalvo, who died drowning. Topless, withered figure with a large bloody carving that reads "18/21".'),
  (24, 'Before his death Richard was an eccentric, angry and somewhat violent or possibly sadistic man who carries a revolver along with him. Under his ghost form he is seen with a bloodied head, wielding a crowbar. Richard''s clothing then has been stained with blood and partly unrecognizable. He emits static sounds and consistently twitch, as his cause of death was electrocution. He moves erratically, even to the point where it seems he does a certain motion, such as swinging his crowbar, backwards. Unlike the game''s other ghosts, he does not float, but he attacks with great celerity and is able to teleport and "phase" across medium distances.', 'Medium', 'A ghostly reincarnation of the late Richard. Withered and decayed, often twitching and emitting static with a crowbar as the weapon of choice.'),
  (25, 'Walter has long parted hair, often hiding his face, which gives a distinct, psychotic expression and dark eye bags. About the similar height as Henry, wearing a blue raincoat stained with blood and trousers. He is seen in select chapters wielding dual pistols, with which he uses to carry out attacks.', 'Medium', 'Main antogonist of Silent Hill 4: The Room. Although he is not a Otherworld being and does not carry a particular psychological representation. His lore expands further than the canon events of Silent Hill 4 and is a significant figure of the franchise.');

-- Insert Movement
INSERT INTO movement (enemy_id, movement_type, speed_level, behavior_pattern) VALUES
  (1, 'Arms Drags', 'Slow to Moderate', 'Moves by using large humanoid arms to walk rather than legs. Its lurching movements arr similar to the Twin Victims but slightly more aggressive. Alternates between spinning arm swings and diving attacks when provoked.'),
  (2, 'Stationary', 'Stationary', 'Not a “moving” enemy in a traditional sense; it appears as a floating, disembodied giant head. Exists as a disturbing “ghost” manifestation; its presence is more atmospheric than combative. Often remains stationary, simply watching Henry.'),
  (3, 'Deliberate Crawls', 'Slow', 'Crawls slowly along walls and floors; its pace is deliberate rather than aggressive. Acts as a background “decorative” enemy: it does not actively pursue or attack Henry. Continually chews on surfaces—its very presence creates holes in the environment.'),
  (4, 'Bounding Jumps', 'Slow', 'Displays a mix of bounding jumps and slow shambolic ambulation. When unarmed, it attempts to punch Henry; if carrying a weapon (like a stolen pipe or golf club), its attack becomes more damaging. Tends to leap from higher platforms, adding a vertical element to its assault.'),
  (5, 'Waddling Arm Drags', 'Slow', 'Moves by “waddling” on large arms without normal lower limbs; their movement is slow but deliberate. Often remains motionless until Henry is close, then suddenly springs into a swinging attack. Can also chase Henry briefly with a diving attack.'),
  (6, 'Slow Treads', 'Slow', 'Moves slowly due to its massive, towering frame. Launches continuous, multi-hit hammer swings in a combo style, with an occasional spin attack when turning around. Can be relentless if not interrupted by a well-timed counterattack.'),
  (7, 'Slow Hovers', 'Slow', 'Hover slowly and unnaturally. They inflict damage simply by being near Henry (a “proximity” effect).  Can be temporarily knocked down by special silver bullets, then permanently pinned with a Sword of Obedience.'),
  (8, 'Erratic Hovers', 'Slow', 'Moves in a manner similar to other humanoid ghosts in the game—slow, erratic, and gliding. Tends to appear in scripted encounters rather than roaming freely; his role is to add narrative tension.'),
  (9, 'Lethargic Treads', 'Slow', 'Moves slowly and almost lethargically. Often roams in predictable patterns in certain environments (e.g. hallways or apartments).'),
  (10, 'Ghostly Hovers', 'Moderate', 'Moves slowly, indistinct presence and stained with blood. Actively targets the protagonist if the impaled object on his chest is removed.'),
  (11, 'Scaling surfaces', 'Moderate', 'A boss that moves deliberately and is capable of scaling surfaces (via its metal frame mechanism). Alternates between direct melee swings and summoning decoys (dummies) that mimic its movements. Its true form is only vulnerable when its decoys are down, requiring the player to target the “real” enemy.'),
  (12, 'Sationary', 'Stationary', 'They are stationary, but once confronted by Henry they create erratic, constant shaking movements. Acts as an obstacle: it’s in the player’s path and causes damage on contact.'),
  (13, 'Slow slithers', 'Slow', 'They slithers steadily, around their area-of-effect. Remains passive until disturbed; if Henry steps on or collides with it, it actively targets him.'),
  (14, 'Deliberate Gaits', 'Slow to Moderate', 'Moves with an eerie, deliberate gait—more measured than other ghost enemies. Actively pursues Henry, often appearing in scripted sequences during boss encounters.'),
  (15, 'Flying', 'Fast', 'Moves very quickly with rapid wing beats. Attacks in swarms; individually, they do only slight damage but can overwhelm in numbers.'),

  (17, 'Drifting Hovers', 'Slow', 'Moves in a slow, drifting manner similar to other ghost enemies. Appears in scripted sequences; her behavior is more eerie than aggressive.'),
  (18, 'Stalking Treads', 'Slow', 'Floats slowly, similar to other ghost variants but with a slightly more purposeful, stalking gait. Recognizable by his more aggressive posture and the fact that he wields a trowel. Will actively pursue Henry if he comes within range.'),
  (19, 'Stalking Drifts', 'Slow', 'Exhibits slow, ghostly drifting movement similar to other minor ghosts. Remains largely in place until Henry approaches, then follows or hovers nearby to inflict its damage.'),
  (20, 'Stationary', 'Stationary', 'Emerges from walls with sudden, jerky movements. Initially remains hidden as part of the wall’s texture; then quickly dashes out to swipe at Henry.'),
